# 🚨 Mkhatjwa Final Year FISA Project

A distributed Java-based security monitoring system developed as part of my **Software Development 2 (SFD2) Final Integrated Student Assessment (FISA)**.

This project simulates a real-world control room environment where multiple client applications communicate with a central server.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The system consists of multiple independent Java applications designed to work together:

- **Control Room Server**
- **Client Guard Application**
- **Client Home Application**

Each component plays a specific role within the simulated security ecosystem.

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

The project follows a **client–server model**:

- The **Control Room Server** acts as the central coordinator.
- Client applications connect to the server.
- Data is exchanged between components.

This demonstrates:

✅ Socket Programming  
✅ Multi-application Communication  
✅ Distributed System Concepts  

---

## 🖥️ Applications Included

### 🔹 Control Room Server
Responsible for:

- Accepting client connections
- Managing communication
- Processing incoming data

---

### 🔹 Client Guard
Simulates a guard-side interface:

- Sends updates to server
- Receives instructions/events
- Demonstrates client networking

---

### 🔹 Client Home
Represents a home/user interface:

- Interacts with server
- Demonstrates remote monitoring logic

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Java Swing / GUI**
- **Socket Programming**
- **NetBeans IDE**
- **Client–Server Networking**

---

## 🎯 Academic Purpose

This project was developed for:

**Software Development 2 (SFD2)**  
Diploma in Computer Engineering

Focus Areas:

- Networking
- Software Architecture
- GUI Development
- System Communication

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open project in **NetBeans IDE**
2. Build the applications
3. Start the **Control Room Server**
4. Run client applications

> ⚠️ Server must be running before clients connect
